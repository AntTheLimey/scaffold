## Two Agent Tiers

### Workflow Agents

Workflow agents own phases of the orchestration pipeline. They are called via the API (AdvisorAgent class), return structured text or JSON, and never write code. Each carries a knowledge base of methodology files that are always loaded in full.

| Agent | Purpose | Model | Execution |
|-------|---------|-------|-----------|
| product_owner | Decompose epics into features and tasks with acceptance criteria | Opus | API |
| architect | Technical design: data models, API contracts, component boundaries, UI detection | Opus | API |
| designer | UI/UX specification | Sonnet | API |
| reviewer | Code review against acceptance criteria; returns approve/revise verdict | Sonnet | CLI |
| qa | Test validation in a git worktree; returns pass/fail verdict | Sonnet | CLI |
| consensus | Deadlock resolution via structured debate | Opus | API |

The reviewer and qa agents use the CLI execution path (DoerAgent) rather than the API, so they operate inside git worktrees and can inspect code directly.

### Specialist Agents

Specialist agents own implementation domains. They divide into two subtypes based on execution model.

**Implementation specialists** write code via the `claude` CLI in git worktrees (DoerAgent class). They iterate until they emit their completion promise or exhaust their iteration budget.

| Specialist | File Types | Max Iterations | Completion Promise |
|------------|-----------|----------------|--------------------|
| python-expert | `.py` | 10 | `TASK COMPLETE` |
| go-expert | `.go` | 10 | `TASK COMPLETE` |
| react-expert | `.tsx`, `.jsx` | 10 | `TASK COMPLETE` |
| typescript-expert | `.ts`, `.js` | 10 | `TASK COMPLETE` |
| documentation-writer | `.md` | 5 | `TASK COMPLETE` |

**Advisory specialists** provide recommendations via the API (AdvisorAgent class) without writing code. They are dispatched in parallel before the implementation specialist runs, and their output is appended to the specialist's assembled prompt.

| Specialist | Triggered By | Purpose |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| postgres-expert | Database detected in project | Query patterns, schema advice, connection pooling |
| security-auditor | Auth/security paths found in repo | Security review, vulnerability analysis |

---

## Prompt Assembly

The `AgentLoader` (`orchestrator/agent_loader.py`) assembles prompts at runtime by layering context sources. The separator between sections is `\n\n---\n\n`.

### Workflow Agent Assembly

1. `agent.md` — base system prompt
2. All files in `knowledge-base/` — sorted alphabetically, concatenated

Knowledge-base files for workflow agents are always loaded in full; no keyword filtering is applied.

### Specialist Agent Assembly

1. `agent.md` — base system prompt
2. Selected knowledge-base files — filtered by keyword matching against task context (see below)
3. `CLAUDE.md` from the target repo — project documentation and conventions
4. `.claude/agents/{name}.md` from the target repo — project-specific override for this specialist
5. Advisory input — recommendations from any advisory specialists dispatched for this task
6. Task context — task ID and technical design output from the architect

### Knowledge Base Selection

For specialists, knowledge-base files are selected by matching task context words against KB filenames:

- The task context string is split into words (lowercased).
- Each KB filename stem is split on `-` to produce keywords (e.g., `testing-patterns` → `testing`, `patterns`).
- A KB file is included if any of its keywords appear in the task context words.
- If no files match, all KB files are included as a fallback.

Example: a task mentioning "testing" causes `testing-patterns.md` to be included. A task with no recognisable keywords gets the full knowledge base.

## Specialist Detection

The developer node (`orchestrator/nodes/developer.py`) selects which implementation specialist to use based on the file types referenced in the architect's output.

### Extension Mapping

| Extension | Specialist |
|-----------|-----------|
| `.py` | python-expert |
| `.go` | go-expert |
| `.tsx` | react-expert |
| `.jsx` | react-expert |
| `.ts` | typescript-expert |
| `.js` | typescript-expert |
| `.sql` | postgres-expert |
| `.md` | documentation-writer |

The mapping is defined in `EXTENSION_TO_SPECIALIST` in `orchestrator/agent_loader.py`. The `detect_specialist` method counts extension occurrences across all file paths in the task output and returns the specialist with the highest count.

### Selection Priority

1. Extract file paths from the architect's output using regex.
2. Count extensions and identify the most-common specialist via `detect_specialist`.
3. If the detected specialist is in the onboarding roster, use it.
4. If not detected, or the detected specialist is not in the roster, use the first specialist from the roster.
5. Fallback: `python-expert`.

Advisory specialists from the onboarding roster are dispatched in parallel before the implementation specialist runs.

---

## Onboarding and Roster Configuration

The onboarding node (`orchestrator/nodes/onboarding.py`) runs at the start of each pipeline execution. It detects the target project and builds two lists stored in state: `specialists` (implementation roster) and `advisory`.

### Language Detection and Specialist Mapping

The onboarding node inspects the target repo for language indicators:

| Indicator | Language Detected |
|-----------|------------------|
| `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, or `requirements.txt` | Python |
| `go.mod` | Go |
| `tsconfig.json` | TypeScript |
| `package.json` (no `tsconfig.json`) | JavaScript |

Language is then mapped to a specialist:

| Language | Default Specialist | Override Condition |
|----------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Python | python-expert | — |
| Go | go-expert | — |
| TypeScript | typescript-expert | react-expert if React detected in dependencies |
| JavaScript | typescript-expert | — |

React is detected by scanning `package.json` dependencies for names that match or are prefixed with `react`, `next`, `vue`, `angular`, `svelte`, `nuxt`, or `remix`.

### Advisory Specialist Triggers

| Trigger | Advisory Specialist Added |
|---------|--------------------------|
| Database dependency detected | postgres-expert |
| Security-related paths found | security-auditor |

**Database detection** checks the following sources for keywords (`psycopg`, `psycopg2`, `postgres`, `sqlalchemy`, `pgx`, `pq`, `pg`, `prisma`, `mysql`, `sqlite`):
- `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt`
- `go.mod`
- `package.json` dependencies
- Any `.sql` files present in the repo

**Security detection** scans all file and directory names in the repo for the keywords `auth`, `security`, `jwt`, or `oauth`.

### Roster Filtering

`AgentLoader.list_specialists()` returns only specialists that have an `agent.md` file in the agents directory. If a specialist is referenced in `config/agents.yaml` but has no `agent.md`, it is excluded from the roster and cannot be selected.

---

## Execution Models

### AdvisorAgent (API)

Defined in `orchestrator/nodes/base.py`.

- Makes a single API call with a system prompt and a user message.
- Returns `AgentResult(text, token_in, token_out)`.
- Supports optional system prompt caching (`cache_control: ephemeral`) for repeated calls with the same system prompt.
- Used by: product_owner, architect, designer, consensus (workflow); postgres-expert, security-auditor (advisory specialists).

### DoerAgent (CLI + Ralph Loop)

Defined in `orchestrator/nodes/base.py`.

- Creates a git worktree for isolation (`git worktree add -b {branch}`). The worktree is placed at `{repo_parent}/.worktrees/{branch-slug}`.
- Runs the `claude` CLI iteratively (`ralph_loop`) up to `max_iterations` times (default: 10).
- Each iteration invokes: `claude --model {model} -p {prompt}` with a 600-second timeout.
- On iteration 2+, the previous attempt's output is appended to the prompt with a retry instruction.
- Declares success when `completion_promise` appears in stdout.
- Returns `RalphResult(success, iterations, output)`.
- Cleans up the worktree on completion (in a `finally` block).
- Used by: python-expert, go-expert, react-expert, typescript-expert, documentation-writer (implementation specialists); reviewer, qa (workflow agents that run CLI).

The qa agent uses `completion_promise = "TESTS PASSING"` and `max_iterations = 8`, configured in `config/agents.yaml`. All other implementation specialists use `"TASK COMPLETE"` and `max_iterations = 10`.

---

## Customizing Agents

### Adding a New Specialist

1. Create the directory: `orchestrator/agents/specialists/{name}/`
2. Write `agent.md` — the system prompt for this specialist.
3. Optionally add `knowledge-base/` with domain reference files. Name files descriptively; the stem is used for keyword matching (e.g., `error-handling.md` matches tasks mentioning "error" or "handling").
4. Add an entry in `config/agents.yaml` under `specialists`. For a CLI specialist:

   ```yaml
   specialists:
     my-specialist:
       model: claude-sonnet-4-6
       execution: cli
       max_iterations: 10
       completion_promise: "TASK COMPLETE"
   ```

   For an advisory specialist:

   ```yaml
   specialists:
     my-advisor:
       model: claude-opus-4-6
       execution: api
   ```

5. If the specialist should be auto-detected from file extensions, add the mapping to `EXTENSION_TO_SPECIALIST` in `orchestrator/agent_loader.py`.
6. If the specialist should be included in the onboarding roster based on language, update `LANGUAGE_TO_SPECIALIST` in `orchestrator/nodes/onboarding.py`.
7. If it's an advisory specialist with a new trigger condition, add detection logic to `make_onboarding_node` in `orchestrator/nodes/onboarding.py`.

### Project-Specific Overrides

Target repos can customize agent behaviour without modifying the scaffold itself.

**Per-specialist override:** `.claude/agents/{specialist-name}.md` in the target repo.
Appended to that specialist's assembled prompt after the repo's `CLAUDE.md`. Use for project-specific coding standards, naming conventions, or constraints that apply only to one specialist.

**Project-wide context:** `CLAUDE.md` in the root of the target repo.
Read by all specialists during prompt assembly. Created (or updated) by `scaffold init`. Contains conventions, off-limits areas, architecture notes, and anything else that should inform all implementation work.

### Modifying Knowledge Bases

Knowledge-base files contain domain expertise: conventions, patterns, checklists.

- Location: `orchestrator/agents/{tier}/{name}/knowledge-base/`
- Format: Markdown
- Naming: descriptive, hyphenated (e.g., `error-handling.md`, `testing-patterns.md`)
- The filename stem is split on `-` and used as keywords for task-context matching

To add domain knowledge, create a new `.md` file in the appropriate `knowledge-base/` directory. No code changes are needed — the loader picks up all files at runtime.

For workflow agents, all KB files are always loaded. For specialists, files are keyword-matched; broader filenames (e.g., `patterns.md`) will match more tasks than narrow ones (e.g., `react-query-patterns.md`).

## Configuration Reference

Agent configuration lives in `config/agents.yaml`. Top-level keys:

| Key | Contents |
|-----|---------|
| `workflow` | One entry per workflow agent with `model` and `execution` |
| `specialists` | One entry per specialist with `model`, `execution`, and optionally `max_iterations`, `completion_promise` |
| `escalation` | Thresholds: `max_review_cycles`, `max_bug_cycles`, `cost_threshold_per_run`, `stuck_loop_model` |

Each agent entry:

| Field | Values | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `model` | model ID string | Model used for this agent |
| `execution` | `api` or `cli` | Determines AdvisorAgent vs DoerAgent |
| `max_iterations` | integer | CLI agents only; max ralph_loop iterations |
| `completion_promise` | string | CLI agents only; substring that signals task completion |
